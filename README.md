# FastAPI Railway Starter

Minimal FastAPI starter template for small backend services, internal tools, ML/AI APIs, and data-focused projects. Managed with `uv` and deployable to Railway in minutes.

## Deploy In Minutes

This template is designed to be deployed to Railway with almost no setup.

Basic flow:

1. Click `Use this template` on GitHub to create your own repository.
2. Clone your new repository locally.
3. Log in to Railway with GitHub.
4. Create a new Railway project using your new GitHub repository.
5. In the Railway settings for the new project, generate a public networking domain on port `8080`.
6. Your app should now be live.

For the default starter app, that can take only a few minutes.

If you prefer, you can also fork this repository or clone it and push it to a new GitHub repository of your own.

The included `railway.toml` already starts the app with:

```toml
[deploy]
startCommand = "uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
```

Once deployed, Railway should serve:

- `/docs`
- `/health`

## What This Includes

- FastAPI app with a health endpoint
- Railway-ready `uvicorn` startup command
- Environment-driven settings via `pydantic-settings`
- Basic stdout logging suitable for Railway
- `pytest` and `ruff` wired in

## Project Structure

```text
app/
  api/
    api.py
    routers/
  core/
  schemas/
  services/
tests/
```

- `app/api/api.py` is the single place where all routers are registered. `main.py` includes this once, so adding a new router only requires a change here.
- `app/api/routers/` contains FastAPI route modules and endpoint definitions.
- `app/core/` contains application-wide setup such as settings, logging, and shared infrastructure code.
- `app/schemas/` is a place for Pydantic request and response models as the API grows.
- `app/services/` is a place for application logic such as model loading, inference code, third-party API clients, database operations, or other reusable business logic.
- `tests/` contains the test suite.

You do not need to use every directory immediately. They are included as sensible starting points, not rigid rules.

## Quick Start

If you are already inside the repo:

```bash
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`

## Local Setup

If you want the full local setup flow after creating your own repository from the template:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Development Commands

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
```

## Configuration

Application settings live in `app/core/config.py`.

The values defined there are local-safe defaults, not production values. They exist so the starter runs immediately without extra setup.

Override settings with environment variables using the `APP_` prefix, either in a local `.env` file or through your deployment platform:

```env
APP_APP_NAME=FastAPI Railway Starter
APP_APP_DESCRIPTION=Minimal FastAPI starter template
APP_ENVIRONMENT=local
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_LOG_LEVEL=info
```

The repo includes `.env.example` as the reference file for supported variables.

### Important

For production deployments, prefer setting environment variables in Railway instead of editing the defaults in `app/core/config.py`.

Typical Railway values:

```env
APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
APP_LOG_LEVEL=info
```

You can also override:

- `APP_APP_NAME`
- `APP_APP_DESCRIPTION`
- `APP_DEBUG`

## Logging Notes

Logs from `uvicorn.error` are expected and normal. Despite the name, uvicorn uses that logger for general messages like startup and shutdown, not just errors. Seeing it in your logs does not mean something is wrong.

## Railway Notes

The deploy command is already configured in `railway.toml`, so no code changes are needed for a basic Railway deploy.
